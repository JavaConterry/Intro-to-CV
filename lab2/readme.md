# Lab 2

<b> Filtering of images </b>
In this lab implemented image filtering on such solutions:
- [ ]  Shift the image by 10 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.
- [x]  Inversion.
- [x]  Gaussian smoothing (filter size at least 11x11).
- [x]  Diagonal motion blur (filter size at least 7x7).
- [x]  Sharpening.
- [x]  Sobel filter (the direction is not important)
- [x]  Border filter
- [x]  additional filter Magnitude of an image

> Comments:
- Also was added some additional filters like random and sobel by x. And more image processing methods like scaling and shifting on the min offset.
