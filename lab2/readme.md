# Lab 2

<b> Filtering of images </b>
In this lab TOBE implemented image filtering on such solutions:
- [ ]  Shift the image by 10 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down.
- [ ]  Inversion.
- [ ]  Gaussian smoothing (filter size at least 11x11).
- [ ]  Diagonal motion blur (filter size at least 7x7).
- [ ]  Sharpening.
- [ ]  Sobel filter (the direction is not important)
- [ ]  Border filter
- [ ]  (discussing) additional filter
